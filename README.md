Ubuntu
======

[`ubuntu`](https://ghcr.io/sgsgermany/ubuntu) is [@SGSGermany](https://github.com/SGSGermany)'s base image for containers based on [Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/). This image is built *daily* at 21:20 UTC on top of the [official Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/_/ubuntu) using [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/SGSGermany/ubuntu/actions/workflows/container-publish.yml).

Rebuilds are triggered only if Ubuntu builds a new image, or if one of the [`ubuntu-oci` base packages](https://git.launchpad.net/cloud-images/+oci/ubuntu-base/) were updated. Currently we create images for both **Ubuntu 22.04 "Jammy Jellyfish"** and **Ubuntu 20.04 "Focal Fossa"**. Please note that we might add or drop branches at any time.

All images are tagged with their Ubuntu version string, build date and build job number (e.g. `v22.04-20190618.1658821493.1`), as well as with the release branch's short codename (e.g. `jammy-20190618.1658821493.1`). The latest build of an Ubuntu release is additionally tagged without the build information (e.g. `v22.04` and `jammy`). The latest build of the latest Ubuntu LTS release is furthermore tagged with `latest`.
